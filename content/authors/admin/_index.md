I'm currently a Ph.D. student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu)
advised by [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from IIT, where I worked with [](https://www.halek.co/)[Kyle Hale](https://www.halek.co/).

My research interests fall mostly into the category of kernel support for specialized
application requirements and parallelism. I enjoy finding novel ways of enabling new
programming models by adding support at the lowest levels of the operating system
kernel. I'm working on an operating system, [Chariot](https://github.com/ChariotOS/chariot)
where I prototype many such extensions.
