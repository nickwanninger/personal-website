I'm a first year Ph.D. student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu)
advised by [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org).

My research interests fall mostly into the category of kernel support for specialized
application requirements and parallelism. I enjoy finding novel ways of enabling new
programming models by adding support at the lowest levels of the operating system
kernel. I'm working on an operating system, [Chariot](https://github.com/ChariotOS/chariot)
where I prototype many such extensions.
