Chariot is a simple unix-like kernel and userspace designed to easily play around in if you are interested in kernel development. It currently supports x86 and RISC-V, and "compiles" for ARM64 (help wanted). It's written in C++ and, with the exception of a few ports for my sanity, is entirely self contained.
